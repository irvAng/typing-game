		<!-- <div>
      <p>
        This is a prototype of a typing game based on the game
        <i>Type of the Dead.</i> The idea is to type the words as fast as possible. The selection of words comes from scientific
        animal names (
        <a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/scientific/" target='_blank'>source: Animals by Scientific Names</a>).
      </p>

      <h4>The game:</h4>
      <p>
        A word will appear in black. Type the words as fast as possible in the box. A new word will show once you have typed the
        prompted word. If time ends before you are able to type the word, a new word will be prompted.
        <br> At the beginning, words are four or less cahracters long (word length &lt;= 4). There will be an increase in word
        lenght every five (5) words. After the 5th increase the words will be eight letters or longer (word length &gt;=
        8).
      </p>

      <h4>From a programming standpoint some interesting features might be: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A timer object that holds several functions including posting to a desired HTML element identified by ID. (MyTimer()
          - line 103)</li>
        <li> Use of 2-dimensional arrays for the word selections. The increase in difficulty is based on word length. (randomWordSelector()
          - line 44)</li>
        <li>Listeners and interaction with the DOM. </li>
        <li>All Javascript code separated from the HTML code. </li>
        <li>Automatic clearing of the input element by length of word (line 86) or by timer (line 126). </li>
        <li>Assertion of correctness. Text color changed with a class (lines 88-98).</li>
        <li>Removing words from array after completing them correctly to avoid repetition.(line 56) </li>
        <li>Timer stops automatically at end and displays a notification message. (line 67 &gt;&gt;&gt; line 138) </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Note: All line numbers refer JS file.</h6>

		<!--     Observations -->
		<!-- <div>
      <h4>Observations on code: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Global space is too polluted, perhaps an object acting in a namespace sort of way would help with this. </li>
        <li>Arrays could be sorted automatically instead of manually, which would make it easier to add more words to the program.</li>
        <li> Code could be improved, maybe rewritten in a more effective and organized way. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

		<!--  Possible future work    -->
		<!-- <div>
      <h4>Possible improvements (future work):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a score. </li>

        <li>Add a general counter.</li>
        <li>Highlight typed key in word and notify of errors per letter (as opposed to per word as it is at the moment). </li>
        <li>Add a reset button. </li>
        <li>Better layout handling, CSS, etc. </li>
        <li>Initiation of time on user's first input. </li>
        <li>An option to select timer length.</li>
